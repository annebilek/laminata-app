# laminata-app

Under development

Displays and calculates the number of parts needed for the desired fence.

## Development

This app is created using HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS only. There is no `package.json` because there are no dependencies (other than Tailwind, which is directly linked in the browser)

For ease of development, it is recommended to use VS Code with the [ms-vscode.live-server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server) extension. Once previewed, you may view the app in the browser of your choice at http://127.0.0.1:3000/
