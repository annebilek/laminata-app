# laminata-app

Under development

Currently displays parts needed for the desired fence and accepts desired fence length.

Still to do:

- update parts list
- calculate number of parts needed for desired fence length
- generate PDF
- send / capture user email


## Development

This app is created using HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS only. At the moment there is no `package.json` because there are no dependencies (other than Tailwind, which is directly linked in the markup). 

This may change to enable PDF generation and email functionality.

For ease of development, it is recommended to use VS Code with the [ms-vscode.live-server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server) extension. Once previewed, you may view the app in the browser of your choice at http://127.0.0.1:3000/
